# Java Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Java projects and code samples showcasing my skills and experience in Java development. It serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my proficiency in various aspects of Java programming.

## Projects

### Project 1: [OOP Physics](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/tree/main/OOP_Physics)

Description: This project demonstrates my ability to combine **_physics with object oriented programming_**. It showcases my skills in implementing graphics, statically distributed in 3D space. 

### Project 2: [Simple Library](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/blob/main/Simple_Library.java)

Description: This project demonstrates my ability to using **_private fields, sorting and storing books_**. It showcases my skills in implementing orders and sorting. 

### Project 3: [Image Processing | Magpies](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/tree/main/Magpies_ImageProcessing)

Description: The Image Processing project in Java focuses on detecting and removing specific patterns (referred to as "magpies") from an input image. It provides functionalities to load an image, convert it into a binary array, search for magpies using a reference image, and generate a clear image with the magpies removed.

### Project 4: [Binary Maze](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/tree/main/Binary%20Maze)

Description: The Binary Maze project in Java aims to solve a maze represented as a text file. It provides functionality to load the maze, find a path from the start to the finish point, and display the solution. The program uses **_depth-first search_** and **_backtracking algorithms_** to navigate through the maze and find the optimal path.

### Project 5: [Plagiarism Detector](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/tree/main/PlagiarismDetector)

Description: This Java program **_detects plagiarism_** among scripts in a directory by comparing their similarity using the Hamming distance algorithm. It identifies copied or identical lines and displays the average Hamming distance and the number of identical lines.

### Project 6: [Multithreading](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/tree/main/MultiThreading)

Description: This project calculates the sum of an array using **_ multithreading_**. It involves dividing the array into partial sums calculated by different threads. The total sum is then obtained by combining these partial sums.

### Project 7: [Console Text Buffering and File Logging](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/tree/main/Console%20Text%20Buffering%20and%20File%20Logging)

Description: Implement a program to **_buffer console_** text and store it in a rolling log file system. The program creates a "data" directory, saves text in "log0.txt", and rolls logs from "log0.txt" to "log5.txt". It handles exceptions for file access and removal.


## Code Samples

In addition to the projects, this repository also includes a collection of Java code samples that showcase my coding style, problem-solving skills, and familiarity with Java best practices. These samples cover various topics, such as:

- Physics: Java class representing a system of N point electric charges, statically distributed in 3D space.
- Simple Library: Java class Book containing three private fields and improving projects with using methods.

Feel free to explore the code samples to get a better understanding of my coding abilities and approach.
