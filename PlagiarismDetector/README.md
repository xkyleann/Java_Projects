### Project 5: [Plagiarism Detector](https://github.com/xkyleann/Java_Portfolio/tree/main/PlagiarismDetector)

Description: This Java program **_detects plagiarism_** among scripts in a directory by comparing their similarity using the Hamming distance algorithm. It identifies copied or identical lines and displays the average Hamming distance and the number of identical lines.

## To run the anti-plagiarism program, follow these steps:
1. Open a text editor and copy the provided code into a new file.
2. Save the file with the name Main.java. Make sure to save it in a directory of your choice.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the Main.java file.
4. Compile the Java file by running the following command:
javac Main.java
5. After successful compilation, run the program using the following command:
java Main
6. The program will start executing. It will compare all the files in the specified working directory for plagiarism.
7. The program will display the results, including whether plagiarism is detected, the average Hamming distance, and the number of identical lines between the files.
8.  Make sure to replace "path/to/working/directory" in the Main.java file with the actual path to your working directory. This directory should contain the files you want to check for plagiarism.

Note: Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer and added to the system's PATH environment variable before running the program.
